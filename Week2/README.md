## Getting started

Hello~ Wellcome to my repository!
At your terminal, please run:

## Introduction

Here's a brief introduction about my repository. There are seven directories named Week1-7 which  contain the codes, datas, sandbox and results for my weekly work. The .gitignore file helps to avoid submitting rubbish files.

## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
